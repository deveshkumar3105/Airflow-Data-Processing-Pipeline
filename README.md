Airflow DAG: Read S3 File and Deduplicate Data
This is an example Apache Airflow DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) that demonstrates how to read a file from Amazon S3 and perform data deduplication using pandas in a PythonOperator.

Prerequisites
Before running this DAG, make sure you have the following:

Apache Airflow installed and configured.
Access to an AWS S3 bucket containing a file named amazon.csv (adjust the bucket name if necessary).
The required Python libraries installed: pandas, apache-airflow, boto3.
DAG Overview
The DAG consists of the following tasks:

s3_sensor_task: A S3KeySensor task that waits for the amazon.csv file to be available in the specified S3 bucket.
read_s3_file_data: A PythonOperator task that reads the contents of the amazon.csv file from S3 using the S3Hook and returns the data.
data_deduplication: A PythonOperator task that receives the data from the previous task and performs data deduplication using pandas. The deduplicated data is returned.
start and end: DummyOperator tasks to mark the start and end of the DAG.
DAG Configuration
The DAG is configured with the following parameters:

Owner: Devesh
Start Date: May 20, 2023
Schedule Interval: Daily
The DAG is set to run daily, and it will start on May 20, 2023. It also sends an email notification to the specified email address on failure.

How to Use
Install Apache Airflow and the necessary Python libraries if you haven't already.
Configure your Airflow environment, including setting up connections to AWS S3 (my_s3_conn) and email notifications (if desired).
Copy the provided code and create a new DAG file in your Airflow DAGs directory.
Adjust the AWS S3 bucket name and other configuration parameters if necessary.
Run or schedule the DAG using the Airflow UI or command-line tools.
Additional Notes
The read_s3_file() function uses the S3Hook to read the contents of the amazon.csv file from the specified S3 bucket.
The deduplicate_data() function performs data deduplication using pandas, dropping any duplicate rows from the dataset.
The resulting deduplicated data is returned in a list of dictionaries format.
The DAG includes error handling and retry mechanisms. It will retry failed tasks up to 2 times, with a retry delay of 5 minutes between retries.
Please feel free to customize and enhance the DAG according to your specific requirements.

Thnak You.
